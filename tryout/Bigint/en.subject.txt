--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In computer science, a bignum is an object representing an arbitrary precision 
number. This is useful when you want to store a number bigger than SIZE_MAX
without any loss of precision. This is often achieved by storing the number 
as an array or a string containing its different "parts".

Create a class called bigint that will store an arbitrary precision unsigned integer.

Your class must support:
- Addition (+, +=).
- Digit shift operations, similar to bit shifts but on base 10 digits:
    (42 << 3 == 42000) and (1337 >> 2 == 13).
- Comparison operators (==, !=, <, <=, >, >=).
- Pre and post increment/decrement operators (++a, a++, --a, a--).

Your bigint must be printable with the << operator (in base 10).
The output must not contain any leading zeros.

Your class must also support compound shift assignments (<<=, >>=) with both int 
and bigint operands.

You will find a main in this directory that must work with your class.
